## An example app using psyneulink

This is a simple example intended for use at the BIDS Computational Models meeting. It demonstrates the use of Docker to run a [psyneulink](https://princetonuniversity.github.io/PsyNeuLink/) model that is fully specified within a json file.  Running the model also requires specification of stimuli, which are contained in a tsv file.  

See the Makefile for examples of how to build and run the model using Docker.
